**Modules** in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. 

Modules are used to:

    - create reusable components
    - improve organization
    - to treat pieces of infrastructure as a black box

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) includes a directory of ready-to-use modules for various common purposes, which can serve as larger building-blocks for your infrastructure.
