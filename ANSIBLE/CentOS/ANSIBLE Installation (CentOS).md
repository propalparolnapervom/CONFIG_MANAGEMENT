# ANSIBLE INSTALLATION (CENTOS)

[Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)


## OVERALL INFO

> Once Ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running.

> When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, so there’s no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version.



## REQUIREMENTS


### Control Machine Requirements

Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2 (versions 2.6 or 2.7) or Python 3 (versions 3.5 and higher) installed (Windows isn’t supported for the control machine).


### Remote Machine Requirements
