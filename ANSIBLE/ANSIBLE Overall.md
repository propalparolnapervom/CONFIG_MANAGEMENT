## ANSIBLE OVERALL

Ansible is a configuration management and orchestration tool.

Ansible can be run directly from the command line without setting up any configuration files. 
You only need to install Ansible on the control server or node. 
It communicates and performs the required tasks using SSH. 
No other installation is required. 
This is different from other orchestration tools like Chef and Puppet where you have to install software both on the control and client nodes.
